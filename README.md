# About Neat Tip

#### Challenges
In Indonesia, the number of motorbike users is massive, with over 80 million motorbikes registered nationwide. In the Greater Jakarta Area alone, there are 8.8 million residents who face difficulty accessing public transportation due to the lack of accessible mass public transportation nodes.

As a result, many of them resort to using private motorbikes to access public transportation, contributing to the issue of limited parking space.

Our mobile app, Neatip, offers a solution to this problem. By digitizing conventional motorbike storage businesses with a mobile-based application, we help business owners and motorbike users.

#### Demo Solution and Explanation
Using Neatip, commuters can locate the nearest available motorbike storage option using Google Maps for location API. Let's consider the example of Abadi, a commuter from Depok who found himself rushing to make it to his class in Jakarta on time. Abadi had to rely on his motorbike to reach the nearest station with available parking, but still arrived only to find that the parking lot was already full.

With Neatip, Abadi could have effortlessly located the nearest available motorbike storage option to ensure a hassle-free and timely commute. Once the motorbike is parked, it is swiftly registered within the system using ML Kit for ML Vision API with a simple check-in scan of the number plate by the motorbike keeper.

When the commuter returns, he can easily retrieve their motorbike with the help of the keeper. Payment is made via our wallet feature, allowing for digital payments through Firestore database for Transactions and Data. The check-out scan process by the commuter is also streamlined with ML Kit for ML Vision API.

#### The Future in Neat Tip
Neatip aims to solve the issue of limited parking space for motorbikes in Indonesia, which is a significant problem considering the large number of motorbikes in the country.

We aim to make opportunities for landowners to establish efficient and optimized motorbike storage businesses, which can in turn enhance economic productivity.

By providing convenient motorbike storage options near public transportation hubs, we can help reduce reliance on private vehicles and contribute towards reducing carbon emissions and combating air pollution.
